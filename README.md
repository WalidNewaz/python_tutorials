## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

This repo is organized like a **mono-repo**.  
Each **section** in the series is represented as a top-level directory, and each **chapter** lives inside its section.

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ section_01_foundations/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chapter_01_env_setup/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chapter_02_syntax_core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chapter_03_files_io/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ section_03_databases/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
...
````

Within each **chapter directory**, you will find:

- `code/` â†’ runnable code examples from the book
- `resources/` â†’ datasets, sample files, or other supporting material
- `assignments/` â†’ starter files and solutions for chapter assignments
