# Python Foundations Series

This repository contains the **companion code and solutions** for the tutorial series [Python Foundations Series](https://www.walidnewaz.com/learn/python/).

The series is designed to take readers from the fundamentals of Python programming all the way to building **production-ready applications**. This course will lay the groundwork for future courses focused on web applications, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence topics.

Within each **chapter directory**, you will find:

- `code/` → runnable code examples from the book
- `resources/` → datasets, sample files, or other supporting material
- `assignments/` → starter files and solutions for chapter assignments
- `README.md` → notes and usage instructions
